      <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
      <p><b>Max Supply: 10,000,000 $RUN</b></p>
            <p>• 50% Liquidity (5,000,000 $RUN): To ensure robust liquidity and stability.</p> 
            <p>• 30% Staking Rewards (3,000,000 $RUN): Rewarding our community is at the heart of Stealth $RUN.</p>
            <p>• 20% Retained for Investments (2,000,000 $RUN): These tokens are reserved for our first two project investments.</p>
      <p><b>Liquidity Pools</b></p>
      <p>Our initial liquidity pools are paired with leading tokens in the Koinos Ecosystem, chosen for their utility and growth potential. The strategic pairings strengthens $RUN's liquidity while also promoting the growth of other projects within the ecosystem. This low liquidity, high expected growth approach positions Stealth $RUN as a catalyst for broader ecosystem development.</p>
      <p>Initial pairs were launched in equal parts with: <b>Koinos, Liquidity UP, Koin Crew Token, Bitkoin, D.A.R.E</b></p>
      <p><b>Staking Pools</b></p>
        <p>Stealth $RUN is designed to be self-sustaining and highly rewarding for holders. At inception, we launched seven staking pools:</p>
          <p>• Five pools to distribute ALL inital LP tokens created for each pool, each running for 3 years.</p>
          <p>• One pool to launch the initial 10% supply staking rewards over the first 30 days.</p>
          <p>• One pool to slowly distribute the final 20% supply through liquidity staking over 12 years.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>As the value of $RUN increases, so do the rewards for stakers. By purchasing $RUN tokens from the $KOIN/$RUN pool and staking them, investors essentially buy into their future wealth, represented by the pool holdings.</p>

      <h2>Plans and Milestones</h2>
          <p>Stealth $RUN is not just a token; it's a vision for the future. As we reach key market cap milestones, we will strategically sell portions of our supply to fund ambitious projects and initiatives.</p>

      <p><b>Real Estate Strategy</b></p>
        <p>All real estate investments will follow a five-year buy-to-sell plan, accounting for ongoing expenses such as property taxes, home insurance, and utilities. When a property is sold, we will look to buy another homes to replace it. By purchasing properties outright with cash, we eliminate mortgage-related costs, ensuring that our assets are fully owned and available exclusively for Stealth $RUN holders and partners.</p> 
<p>Holders can book accomodations in any of our owned properties using $RUN tokens, with 50% of tokens received being burned and 50% retained for future milestones.</p>
