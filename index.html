  <h1>Stealth $RUN Whitepaper</h1>
  <p>Introduction
Welcome to Stealth $RUN, the revolutionary crypto project designed to reward holders and foster growth within the Koinos Ecosystem. Imagine a world where your investment not only appreciates but also contributes to tangible real-world assets and social good. With a capped supply of 10,000,000 tokens and zero transaction tax, Stealth $RUN offers a unique and compelling opportunity for investors and enthusiasts alike.
Supply Allocation
Max Supply: 10,000,000 $RUN
•	50% Liquidity (5,000,000 $RUN): To ensure robust liquidity and stability, we have allocated 50% of the total supply across five strategic pairs:
o	$KOIN, $UP, $KCT, $BTK, $DRUGS
•	30% Staking Rewards (3,000,000 $RUN): Rewarding our community is at the heart of Stealth $RUN. Staking rewards are distributed as follows:
o	10% (1,000,000 $RUN) released over the first 30 days through Single Side Staking.
o	20% (2,000,000 $RUN) distributed over the next 12 years via liquidity staking $RUN/$KOIN.
•	20% Retained for Investments (2,000,000 $RUN): These tokens are reserved for our first two major project investments, ensuring continuous growth and development.
How It Works
Stealth $RUN is designed to be self-sustaining and highly rewarding for holders. At inception, we launched seven staking pools:
•	Five pools distribute LP tokens from each of the five initial liquidity pairs.
•	One pool handles the initial 10% staking rewards.
•	The final pool manages the long-term 20% supply release for liquidity staking.
As the value of $RUN increases, so do the rewards for stakers. By purchasing $RUN tokens from the $KOIN/$RUN pool and staking them, investors essentially buy into their future wealth, represented by the pool holdings.
Strategic Liquidity Pools
Our initial liquidity pools are paired with leading tokens in the Koinos Ecosystem, chosen for their utility and growth potential. This strategic pairing strengthens $RUN's liquidity while also promoting the growth of other projects within the ecosystem. This low liquidity, high expected growth approach positions Stealth $RUN as a catalyst for broader ecosystem development.
Project Plans and Milestones
Stealth $RUN is not just a token; it's a vision for the future. As we reach key market cap milestones, we will strategically sell portions of our supply to fund ambitious projects and initiatives.
•	Milestone 1: $1,500,000 Market Cap
o	Action: Sell 10% supply
o	Value Extracted: $150,000
o	Project: Build a Single Family Home
•	Milestone 2: $10,000,000 Market Cap

o	Value Extracted: $100,000,000+
o	Project: Provide Free Housing, Food, Water, and Medical Aid Worldwide
Real Estate Investment Strategy
All real estate investments will follow a five-year buy-to-sell plan, accounting for ongoing expenses such as property taxes, home insurance, and utilities. When a property is sold, we will look to buy another homes to replace it. By purchasing properties outright with cash, we eliminate mortgage-related costs, ensuring that our assets are fully owned and available exclusively for Stealth $RUN holders and partners. 
Holders can book stays in any of our owned properties using $RUN tokens, with 50% of tokens received being burned and 50% retained for future milestones.
